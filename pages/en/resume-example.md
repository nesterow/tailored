## PROJECTS

- **Pneumonia Detection using CNN, keras** ( DL ) (using chest X-ray images)
  [Apr’22-present]
  - CNN implementation with GLCM. Using X-ray Dataset from Kaggle.
  - Currently working on optimization of the model.

- **Project Smart Radio Telescope (SmART)** (The Astronomy Club Manipal)
  - A smart radio telescope (SmART) with DSP, ML and AI based capabilities to
    perform with better accuracy than manual radio telescope; powered with star
    tracker, and barn-door tracker.

- **Project Climatious ( Recommender System + DL )** (Faculty: Mr.Tribikram,
  Mrs.Swathi , Ms.Pujari) [Mar’22-present]
  - Submitted work: (B.Tech Course Project — ICT 3264, 3265, 3266)
    - Tracking the increasing non-biodegradable material usage for various
      e-commerce products & ”green” rating them.
    - Python based Recommender System using Collaborative Filtering with
      correlation of 90% - 99.99% based on category & user ratings using Amazon
      Products Dataset. (MERN) web & flutter app implementation of project.

- **Data Visualization & Understanding using Tableau & Data Analytics using
  python** (microProjects) [Feb’22]
  - Created various statistical visualisations and performed statistical
    analysis on COVID-19 dataset in python.
  - Created dashboard using Tableau / Google Data Studio for COVID-19, sales,
    wine testing & trafficking dataset.
  - Drawing conclusions based on the visualizations.

- **SVM implementation on PIMA dataset** ( ML ) (Diabetes Detection) [Feb’22]
  - Achieved a base with input data frame shape (768 , 9) accuracy score of
    78.5% with input data & 76.7% with test data.

- **Gaussian Naive Bayes Implementation to prove no generalized correlation
  failure & launch day** [premium made up science project]
  - Space Missions dataset from Kaggle [2897 train + 1427 test data]
  - Obtained maximum of 90.11% accuracy suggesting no correlation between day
    {Sun, Mon, Tue, etc} and launch company given 92% data suggests success of
    the mission. [incomplete pattern]
  - This further suggests the possibility of rocket scientists showing no
    "significant" bias in their behavior or emotions towards a particular day.

## Current Scientific Study

- **PROJECT CLIMATIOUS** - Climate Conscious World [Mar 2022 - present]
  - Stage 1 [Mar 2022 - Apr 2022]
    - Finding a better approach to the method suggested in the research paper -
      "_Jianmo Ni, Jiacheng Li, J. M., March 2019. Justifying recommendations
      using distantly-labeled reviews and fined-grained aspects EMNLP_"
    - Using Collaborative filtering to obtain higher quality recommendations.
  - Stage 2 [Apr 2022 - present]
    - Material Recognition And Classifier using DL
    - Recognition of materials using image source followed with estimating
      composition of the object.
    - Subjecting the above results to probabilistic approach in determining
      their impact on the environment.

- **LIMONA** - LInear Microchip-On-Neuron Assembly (Comprehensive
  Microchip-on-Neuron Integrating Interface)[Oct 2021 - present]
  - Theoritical interfacing assembly unit for integrating microchip on a human
    neurons.
  - In layman terms, attachment of a virus is achieved when specific proteins on
    the viral capsid or viral envelope bind to specific proteins called receptor
    proteins on the cell membrane of the target cell. How this can be
    implemented artificially using circuits & code?

- **Time Efficient Data Storage {TEDS} Model & Algorithms for Bio-Computers**
  [Aug 2021 - present]
  - Model depicting time efficient implementation of organic biomolecules for
    storage.
  - Research on implementation of non-binary base system at molecular level as a
    way to improve readability and computational speeds.
  - Development of a base-12 math from scratch.

## INTERESTED IN

- **Haptic Holographic Technology** - Holograms with Touch Sensation.
  - Currently, these haptic feedbacks from interactive holograms developed by
    various firms, such as Asukanet or in colleges/ universities such as Glasgow
    University use sound waves technology. Some day soon, I wish to make usage
    of more effective methods to better the haptic feedback received when
    interacting with the holographic projections.

- **Sequential Decision-making under uncertainty**
  - Forming definable boundaries numeric in nature to cater for ease in
    determining decisions based on various abilities of humans.
  - Optimizing human strategies and approach using heterogeneous data.
